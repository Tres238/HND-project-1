    <h2>My Bio</h2> 
    <p>Hi, I’m <strong>Treasure Kenule</strong> a passionate frontend developer and virtual assistant with a love for creating clean, responsive, and user-friendly web designs. I started my web development journey in early 2025, and since then, I’ve built several small projects including product cards, landing pages, and a personal portfolio site.</p>

   <section data-testid="test-about-goals"> 
    <h2>Goals in this Program</h2> 
    <p>My main goal in the HNG internship is to strengthen my skills in JavaScript, improve my understanding of real-world frontend workflows, and learn to collaborate effectively with other developers. I also want to become confident in solving complex UI challenges independently.</p> 
   </section> 
   <section data-testid="test-about-confidence"> 
    <h2>Areas of Low Confidence</h2> 
    <p>I’m still building my confidence with advanced JavaScript concepts and debugging. Sometimes, I find it challenging to handle responsive layouts for all screen sizes, but I’m determined to improve through consistent practice.</p>

   <section data-testid="test-about-future-note"> 
    <h2>Note to My Future Self</h2> 
    <p>Keep pushing forward, Treasure! Every small project you build is another step toward becoming a professional frontend developer. Never stop learning, and remember how far you’ve come since writing your first line of code!</p> 
   </section> 
   <section data-testid="test-about-extra"> 
    <h2>Extra Thoughts</h2> 
    <p>This internship has already helped me grow in discipline and teamwork. I look forward to contributing to real projects and building more responsive, accessible, and beautiful web applications.</p>
